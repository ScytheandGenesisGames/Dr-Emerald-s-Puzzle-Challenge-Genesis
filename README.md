# Dr-Emerald-s-Puzzle-Challenge
A Genesis Homebrew game made with SGDK and this is inspired by Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine

## What this Game will have?

* My Characters from my series like Dr. Anna Emerald to Alexander himself
* Puyo Puyo like engine
* Many Modes to play

This game is meant to be my own version of Dr. Robotnik's Mean Machine with my characters and story of how Anna Emerald is using the beans that Alex needs for his medicine he makes.
This is a homebrew game I wish to make for the SEGA Genesis and makes as many copies I can before I decide to stop production.
